## Create the Hasura Project

## Connect a database

This step you might typically have your own database

## Insert our tables

This step is important that we know the shape of our user table. The specific namings are not important, but the consistent naming will need to be adapted throughout the entire code base if you have something different than what we are using here.

```sql
CREATE TABLE public."user" (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    email text NOT NULL,
    password text NOT NULL,
    avatar text,
);


ALTER TABLE public."user" ALTER COLUMN id ADD GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (
    SEQUENCE NAME public.user_id_seq
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NO MINVALUE
    NO MAXVALUE
    CACHE 1
);

ALTER TABLE ONLY public."user"
    ADD CONSTRAINT user_email_key UNIQUE (email);

ALTER TABLE ONLY public."user"
    ADD CONSTRAINT user_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);

CREATE TRIGGER set_user_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON public."user" FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.set_current_timestamp_updated_at();
```

## Conenct our metadata structure

## Create a NextJS typescript project

`npx create-next-app@latest --ts project-name`
Follow on the onscreen prompts.

## Make API Paths

Delete `/pages/api/hello.ts`

These first two map to Hasura actions, so, for organization, we'll nest them in an actions folder. This is not required.
`/pages/api/actions/signup.ts`
`/pages/api/actions/login.ts`
This is an API route we'll only call from this client application.
`/pages/api/signout.ts`
